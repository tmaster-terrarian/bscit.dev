# rikuo

rikuo is a fictional realm that takes the shape of a collection of memories.
it is much like a tiny curated slice of a personal [library of babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel), with hand-picked excerpts of one's life.

everyone has their own variation of rikuo, and they come in many forms, shapes and sizes.
