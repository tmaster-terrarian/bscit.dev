# Open Source is Resistance

On January 5th, 2025, I fully switched from Windows to Arch Linux. I've used Windows my entire life up until this point.

Initially, I had lost everything that I hadn't backed up in the switch. Since I chose to install nothing but a window manager, it was truly barren and devoid of any of the typical components of a desktop environment like windows.

And yet, even though this sounds pretty cliche, I felt like I was finally free.

Over the months leading up to that change, I was running into problem after problem with Windows, microfriction everywhere that built up to having an overall sense of frustration toward my own computer. I was completely subjected to the tools provided by the OS. Whenever an issue springs up that cannot be solved by a built-in tool, everyone throws their hands up in the air and says "welp, it's over for your computer, time to buy a new one!"

The core of the problem stems from the design of Windows. Windows assumes that by being the industry standard, it must be able to solve any problem for its users, so long as its users are willing to stay within the box it defines. This has such a stark contrast to things like Arch, because on one hand you have to just hope that a restart or a system update will solve it, and on the other you can pinpoint and debug the issue directly, with nothing but a terminal and a little bit of wit.

Arch Linux was particularly appealing to me because it completely dismantles the idea of an operating system that tries to solve your problems for you. Absolutely nothing goes behind your back or obfuscates what it's doing. It's a brutally honest environment that makes sure that the user's autonomy stands before everything. If you want to know how something works, you can easily find its source code and see for yourself.

To refer back to the title, I think that windows, iOS, and even partially MacOS, are built on the same systems of oppression that colonialist and by extension capitalist ideals have been. They create a hierarchy that enforces a world where the user is a customer, and their computer is a service. Windows for example, is notorious for making it nearly impossible to prevent automatic system updates. It creates this environment where the users are not in control of their own life, which very likely reminds you of something pretty similar--reality.

Most of the world, but especially the United States, is controlled by the elite and priviledged. The government is run on big pockets and deceit. It presents itself as a structured, strong-armed workforce that protects the nation from corruption. However, that dreamy reality is difficult to believe in if you are anyone other than a rich white man.

big companies hide things from eachother but especially their customers in order to get an edge in the market. If nobody knows how it works on the inside, the harder it is to point out their flaws. They also try to maximize profit by making it seem that there are no other options besides themselves, or that you are losing something important if you stop participating in their products. Microsoft has incredibly successfully sold the idea that they are the number one place to get an operating system, that all options besides it are objectively worse, that you are nothing without Windows.

I can say that I have been quite comfortable without it for almost 3 months now. Yes, occasionally an issue comes up, but I'm able to solve it quickly because of how open my entire system is.

When someone switches off of a corporate solution, it puts a small wound into the oppressive system that we live in. You disappear off of their lists and analytics. completely separated from their perfect little box. They hate people who decide to leave because of this. People who are self employed and only get paid in cash, people who go out of their way to create free and effective solutions for things normally high priced, people who pirate and uncover lost media, people who share their wealth with others, are all similarly dangerous to the system, because they defy the hierarchy and structure.

You can make a difference by looking deeper for alternatives that are by the people, for the people. If you share similar experiences you should feel a drive to make a difference in your own life, and by extension, the rest of your community will benefit too.
