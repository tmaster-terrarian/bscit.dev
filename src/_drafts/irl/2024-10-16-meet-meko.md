Hello, today I'm going to introduce a new character. Her name is Meko, and I think I will be writing to her in the form of letters, as a sort of way to get over myself when it comes to writing.

So, hi Meko,

It's currently the middle of October, 2024.

I'm an 18 year old senior student in high school, who struggles often with classwork and excels at personal interests, for some reasons unknown. I am also trans and prefer to go by she/they online and they/them irl (not sure why theres a difference still..). My personal interests are mainly comprised of software/game development and everything around that, traditional and digital art, some music, and a tiny bit of writing. I wonder what things you're into? I know for sure that I'm practically obsessed with coding, all the logical thought process and everything to do with it, as well as the community involved with it (but not tech bros, they can burn in the pits of hell, please and thank you :3).

Lately, school has been pretty crushing, but I'm getting through it (I turned in one of my week old assignments yesterday!!). I'm preparing for adulting slowly but surely as well, but also procrastinating it like crazy. So it's hard, but I'm getting there.

Well, I hope you had a nice day Meko.
