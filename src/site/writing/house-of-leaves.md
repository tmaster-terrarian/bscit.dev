# [House] of Leaves (retrospective) {#house-of-leaves}

A personal review and sort of postmortem after reading *[House] of Leaves*.

to be frank i don't know how to start this. i'm not even sure where this will lead. shortly after finishing *[House] of Leaves*, i just sat down at my desk and opened my text editor, all the while listening to the album *Haunted* by Poe for probably the 20th time. call it obsession but to be honest i don't think i can easily find any other music quite as unique and raw as that. one could say i myself am "haunted."

naturally there are spoilers ahead. here be dragons.

with that out of the way, i have so many questions. where's the Last Interview? did i read it and simply forget it was there? are any of the references that Zampanò cited, real? could the story have been based on a real location within Virginia, or just the *idea* of one? why did both Daisy and Johnny's mother have a (sweet Spanish, sweet) Spanish doll?

i hope Johnny found peace of mind, and a lasting therapist. i hope that the [house] never swallowed anyone again, and yet, i am drawn to the idea of further stories set within that fateful location on Ash Tree Lane. such a paradox!

yesterday, on Christmas, i was gifted the book by my younger brother. i read it continously until completion (even to an unhealthy extent, to which i then questioned whether i was becoming just like Johnny Truant himself (i just got dehydrated (lmao))). suffice to say, the entirely unrelated and shiny new digital copy of *Hades II* had to wait until i had read the entirety of the book.

small tangent paragraph ahead. exactly once, Zampanò used the self-identifying pronoun "me" when describing the feelings of one of the explorers who braves the [house], and nobody made note about it! i don't even remember which page this happened on, it may as well have been a typo. but i cant stop thinking about how theres a possibility that Zampanò was actually there...

honestly in retrospect it sounds at the very least, extremely far fetched. it very well must be a typo then. funny how thoughts work like that.

i must admit that i did listen to *Haunted*, at least 19 times, before reading the book. even still, the book served to provide an immense amount of context for some of the stranger parts of the album, such as the end of *Walk the Walk*: "there's someone knocking in the wall" (which was referring to Wax and Jed's SOS call during Exploration #4), and the numerous repititions of the phrase "ba. dah. ba-ba." across the album (which was referring to Daisy's (or Anne's, as seen in *Haunted*) coping mechanism during the aftermath of Exploration #4, before Navidson returned. this also shows that Daisy seemed to hold onto that coping method long after she had moved out of the [house]). the book also further prooved that Daisy got really mentally fucked up by that [house]'s darkness.

it was also fun to see the differences between the album and the book. let me know if i got this wrong, but i'm pretty sure the Johnny featured in *Haunted* (and *Hello*, also by Poe), is not the same person as the Johnny (nor Johnnie) in *[House] of Leaves*. in addition, i honestly shouldn't have been surprised that the book would contain as much sex as it does, given the corresponding album's themes.

you know, the way i was brought to this incredible pairing of arts, was by yet another piece of art, this one in video form. there is this short series of videos primarily known as "Bedrock.zip," created and published on Youtube by Zeemyth. in the first video, [*BEDROCK.ZIP: Solving a Missing Player's Minecraft World*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvUno-iaIAw),[^1] at the very end segments (incidentally named "Still" followed by "Haunted"), there plays the titular song from the album that shares its namesake. i've watched the video several times following its initial release.

since it's a certifiable (or at least testifiable) banger, i went to listen to the full album and fell in love.

reading the book also served to help me solve some of the mysteries within the two episodes of Bedrock.zip, which is nice.

if i had to use a linear score to attempt to rate the piece of work in a very limited and lacking fashion, it would be a 10/10. of course, numbers are utterly meaningless when placed on art.

~i wish that i could hack in a feature to my website that would highlight every instance of "[house]" in blue, for only this article.~[^2] no matter. it is a good book regardless of my representation. i highly recommend it.

[^1]: apologies in advance if the video (or Youtube itself) was taken down by the time you got to read this. it really was quite good, and i'm sorry. (i also envy the possibility that you are prospering in a world without corporate rule. please invent time travel and take me there, my email is open!)

[^2]: i figured it out, man [Nue](https://nuejs.org) is awesome!
