# recipes

at the time that i write this on a wednesday night in December 2025, my grandmother Nanna died peacefully in a nursing home just a month or two ago.

in light of that, i've decided to archive our family's recipes, most of which were written by her decades ago. this page will never have ads or newsletters or other nonsense like that, so you can trust that the recipes will remain accessible for as long as this website lives. i hope that these silly little cooking recipe cards are useful to you too.

this page will continue to expand as i add recipes.
