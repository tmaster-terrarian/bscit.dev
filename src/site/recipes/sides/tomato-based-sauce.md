# Tomato Based Sauce
yields a few cups of sauce

contains: hella tomato

## ingredients
- 6 oz (1 can) tomato paste
- 6 oz water
- 15.5 oz (1 can) diced tomatoes
- ~1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp granulated onion
- 1/2 tsp granulated garlic
- 1/2 tsp thyme

## process
not written, but i have a pretty solid idea on how it's made:
- in a skillet on low heat, mix together tomato paste, water, and diced tomatoes.
- add seasonings
- cook until it tastes right

## bscit's notes
- looks like they put in too much sugar the first time around lol
