# Good Times Casserole
very very cheesy and saucy pasta. a fan favorite among my siblings.

6 servings

contains: gluten, meat, dairy, tomato

## ingredients
- 1.5 lbs Pasta, Cooked, drained
- 1 lb Hamburger, Browned w/ onion & steak seasoning
- 1 tbsp Steak seasoning
- 1 tbsp Dried onion flakes
- 8 oz Medium chedder cheese, cubed 0.25" (~0.5cm)
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce. Add to browned hamburger after removing from heat
- 23 oz (1 lg can) Campbell canned tomato soup. Add to browned hamburger after removing from heat

## process
Brown hamburger + cook pasta. Drain both. Add cheese to pasta in pot, then pour sauce (hamburger, tomato soup) over the top. Wait 1 min (to melt the cheese). Then stir w/ spatula and serve hot.

## bscit's notes
- it's important to note that you should also drain the hamburger grease before adding sauce, it makes the sauce too runny! (and stomach-wrecking)
- if you don't have onion flakes, ~2 teaspoons of onion powder works as a substitute. if you dont have onion powder, maybe some diced onion will do the trick? i havent tried that yet!
- you can try using 0.5" (1cm) cubes of cheese to make clumps of cheesiness more common, if you're into that kind of thing
- sharp cheddar goes hard with this recipe
- a little salt is recommended. and lots of pepper!!!
