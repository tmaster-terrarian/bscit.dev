you have found yourself in [rikuo](./rikuo.html), an unfiltered library of anything that i've felt like publishing. feel free to explore this archive while you're here.

at the moment, the site is going under a complete reconstruction. if you want to see the older version, you can clone the [legacy branch](https://github.com/tmaster-terrarian/bscit.dev/tree/legacy) of the repository and build it with jekyll.
