you have found yourself in [rikuo](./rikuo.html), an unfiltered library of anything that i've felt like publishing. feel free to explore this archive while you're here.

at the moment, the site is undergoing a complete reconstruction. if you want to see the older version, you can clone the <a href="https://github.com/tmaster-terrarian/bscit.dev/tree/legacy" target="_blank">legacy branch</a> of the repository and build it with jekyll.
