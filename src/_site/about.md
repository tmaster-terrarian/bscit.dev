# about

to put it simply, i am an <a href="https://autisticgirlsnetwork.org/audhd/" target="_blank">AuDHD</a>, transgender artist who enjoys making things.

i create <a href="https://brandur.org/small-sharp-tools" target="_blank">small, sharp tools</a> to solve my own problems and workflows, love to tinker with software, and apire to create videogames as a career. at the moment, i am building up a resume to be able to apply for jobs, but in the meantime i am creating art and games at my own pace.
